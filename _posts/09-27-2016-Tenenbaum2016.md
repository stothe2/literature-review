# Summary

Paper proposes an alternative theory for occluded object perception taskâ€”causal reasoning or analysis-by-synthesis over being indifferent to variations; and for causal reasoning to take place, object representation would have to have a minimum set of physical attributes: 3D geometry, rigidity, mechanical material properties, and optical material properties.

Experiment consists of object-under-cloth tasks.

# Takeaway

Though the analysis-by-synthesis model they described includes prior beliefs $\delta\_p$ (physics engine) and $\delta_g$ (graphics engine), there's no test for *minimum* number of physical attributes required for the true model to succeed.
