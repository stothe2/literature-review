title: "Discovering event structure in continuous narrative perception and memory"
---

Continuous perceptual stimuli gets chunked into segments that are meaningful.

Information can be chunked at different timescales (words, sentences, paragraphs, chapters,...). Distributed topographical hierarchy of timescales -> short timescales 10ms-100ms in early sensory regions, longer timescales 10s-100s in higher-order areas. Progressive integration.

On long-term memory. Event segments formed during percetion serve as "episodes" of episodic memory. However, at what timescale should these snapshots be taken? Continuous update, or record only after event has taken place?
