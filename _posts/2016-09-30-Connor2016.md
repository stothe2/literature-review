title: "Representation of Gravity-Aligned Scene Structure in Ventral Pathway Visual Cortex"
---

# Summary

A commonly held view is that the dorsal visual pathway = spatial processing while the ventral visual pathway = object recognition. Authors add to the findings that ventral pathway is also used for physical scene understandingâ€”neurons in the pathway are shown encode information about collective (not individual, so individual scene structure is ambiguous at best) gravity-aligned scene structures in egocentric frame of reference.

# Methods

Studied ventral visual pathway neurons of rhesus macaque monkeys that have be shown to be senstitive to scence stimuli > object stimuli.

# Takeaways
