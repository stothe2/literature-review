# Summary

Size-Weight Illusion (SWI) is one in which smaller object *feels* heavier even though one might reason it to be lighter in comparison to a larger object. In past, this problem was seen as "anti-Bayesian" since Bayesian modelling predicted that the smaller object should feel *lighter*. However, past models only accounted for mass (observable variable), and not density (hidden variable). Accounting for both in a competitive-hypothesis framework (Yuille & BÃ¼lthoff, 1996) by taking competing values of densities, Bayesian inference can explain SWI.
