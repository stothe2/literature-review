I didn't read the entire paper, but only the last two sections. However, since they stood out, I had to post them, lest I forget.

- Piaget and other empiricists have proposed that infants acquire knowledge by interacting with the world/environment. However, "object-directed reaching and manipulation typically begin to emerge during 5mo of life", and "The capacities to to locomote and to coordinate distinct actions emerge later still." (p 428). 
- Quine and others have said that human knowledge is a social constuct, i.e., we acquire knoweldge through language and getsures. Infant studies have shown otherwise--"children do not begin to communicate with words until the end 5yrs, however, they do not communicate with gestures until about 9mo." (p 428).

#### Things to think about, as pointed by Spelke
1. Cognitive domains specifically for intuitive physics, psychology, etc.?
2. How do we gain knowledge *independent* of motor and verbal/written/gestural feedback?
3. How is the knowledge physically represented in our brain?
